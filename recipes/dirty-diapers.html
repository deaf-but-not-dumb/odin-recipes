    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tastes like mini-slider cheeseburgers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated crescent roll dough</li>
        <li>8 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>32 slices dill pickle</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Place ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Add the onion to the skillet; cook and stir until tender. Drain off grease.</li>
        <li>Unroll the crescent roll dough on a clean surface. Separate the triangles and then cut each triangle in half diagonally to make two smaller triangles. Stack the slices of cheese and cut diagonally into 4 triangles. Place one triangle of cheese onto each triangle of dough. Spoon about a tablespoon of ground beef over the cheese and then top with a slice of pickle. Fold the points of the dough towards the center like a diaper and place on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
